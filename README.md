# HMEC_ECMs

This project is a data mining exploration of the two MEMA HMEC cell line datasets, focusing on the ECM proteins. 
There are eight replicate MEMAs in each cell line dataset, each in a different plate. Each MEMA spot is a combination of COL1 and one of forty seven ECM proteins. Of the 694 MEMA spots, there are 99 COL1-only spots used as controls and ~13 replicate spots of the other proteins. The COL1-only spots are in a grid that covers the entire MEMA. The replicates are randomly distrbuted. 

All eight plates of a cell line were processed as a batch.

This analysis is based on cell-level data that has been summarized to the spot and ECM protein levels.
