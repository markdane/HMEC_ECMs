# HMEC_ECMs

This project is a data mining exploration of the signals modulated by the ECM (Extracellular Matrix) proteins in the two MEMA (Microenvironment Microarray) HMEC cell line datasets from Oregon Health and Science University's MEP-LINCS project https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2862345/wiki/394513.  

There are eight replicate MEMAs in each cell line dataset, each in a different plate. Each MEMA contains 694 spots that are a combination of collagen 1 (COL1) and one of forty seven ECM proteins. Additonally, there 99 are COL1-only spots in an open grid that covers the entire MEMA. The other proteins are randomly distributed with ~13 replicate spots each. 

All eight plates of a cell line were processed as a batch.

This analysis is based on cell-level data that has been summarized to the spot and ECM protein levels.
